# Clustering Comparison

To run the code, follow the steps below:

1. Run `python clustering.py` to run experiments with KMeans and GMM.
2. Run `python decomposition.py` to run experiments with PCA, ICA, RCA and RFCA.
3. Run `python combined.py` to run experiments combining dimensionality reduction algorithms in step 2 to the clustering algorithms in step 1.
4. Run `python neuralnet.py` and `python clusternet.py` to run experiments that apply dimensionality reduction and clustering algorithms as a feature transformation to neural network training.
5. Run `python charts.py` to generate the charts.
